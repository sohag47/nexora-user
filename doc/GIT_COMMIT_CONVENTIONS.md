## Commit Types

Use one of the following types to categorize your commit:

| Type         | Purpose                                           | Example                                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **feat**     | A new feature                                     | `feat(auth): add two-factor authentication` |
| **fix**      | A bug fix                                         | `fix(database): resolve connection timeout` |

## Scope

The scope specifies which part of the codebase is affected. It should be concise and descriptive.

**Common scopes in this repository:**

- `makefile` - Makefile changes
- `shell` - Shell scripts
- `javascript` - JavaScript files
- `build` - Build process
- `scripts` - Script utilities
- `config` - Configuration files
- `docs` - Documentation

**Scope is optional** but highly recommended for clarity.

### Scope Examples:

```
feat(makefile): add deployment target
fix(shell): correct script permissions
docs(javascript): add utility function docs
refactor(scripts): improve error handling
```

---

## Subject Line

The subject is a concise description of the change.

### Rules:

- ✅ **Use imperative mood**: "add", "fix", "remove" (not "added", "fixed", "removed")
- ✅ **Lowercase**: Start with lowercase letter
- ✅ **No period**: Do not end with a period or punctuation
- ✅ **Concise**: Maximum 50 characters
- ✅ **Specific**: Describe what changed, not why

### Good Examples:

```
feat(makefile): add test automation target
fix(shell): correct file path resolution
refactor(javascript): improve error handling
docs(scripts): add usage instructions
style(code): fix indentation inconsistencies
test(build): add makefile validation tests
```

### Bad Examples:

```
❌ Fixed bugs in the script
❌ Updated stuff
❌ feat(makefile): This commit adds a new feature to the Makefile...
❌ wip: working on stuff
❌ Fix.
```

---

## Body

The body explains **what** and **why**, not **how**. It should provide context for the change.

### Rules:

- Wrap at 72 characters
- Separate from subject with a blank line
- Explain the problem and solution
- Use bullet points for multiple changes
- Reference related issues or PRs

### Body Examples:

**Makefile feature:**

```
feat(makefile): add Docker build and push targets

Add convenient make targets for building and pushing Docker images
to the registry. This streamlines the containerization workflow.

Changes:
- Add build target for Docker image compilation
- Add push target for registry uploads
- Include environment variable support
```

**Shell script fix:**

```
fix(shell): correct path resolution in deploy script

The script was using relative paths that failed when invoked from
different directories. Changed to use absolute paths based on script
location.
```

**JavaScript refactoring:**

```
refactor(javascript): extract utility functions into modules

Move repeated utility code into separate, reusable modules to:
- Improve code maintainability
- Enable better unit testing
- Reduce code duplication
```

### Bug Fix Commit

```
fix(shell): resolve permission denied errors in deploy script

The deploy script lacked execute permissions when pulled from the
repository. Added chmod command in post-checkout hook and updated
documentation.

Fixes #567
```

### Documentation Commit

```
docs(scripts): add comprehensive usage guide

Add detailed documentation for all available scripts including:
- Purpose and usage of each script
- Required environment variables
- Common error troubleshooting
- Examples for each use case

- Document setup.sh
- Document deploy.sh
- Document build.sh
- Add troubleshooting section
```

### Refactoring Commit

```
refactor(javascript): consolidate utility functions

Extract repeated utility code from multiple files into a dedicated
utils module. This reduces duplication and improves maintainability.

No functional changes - all tests pass.
```

### Chore Commit

```
chore(deps): update Node.js to v18.0.0

Update project dependencies:
- Node.js: 16.13.0 → 18.0.0
- ESLint: 7.x → 8.x
- Prettier: 2.x → 3.x

All tests passing. No breaking changes.
```

## Best Practices

### ✅ DO:

1. **Write atomic commits**: Each commit should represent one logical change

    ```
    Good: One commit for adding feature, another for tests
    Bad: Everything in a single "fixed stuff" commit
    ```

2. **Commit frequently**: Small, focused commits are easier to review and debug

    ```
    Good: 10 focused commits
    Bad: 1 massive commit with 50 files changed
    ```

3. **Test before committing**: Ensure all tests pass before making a commit

    ```bash
    make test
    git commit -m "feat(feature): add new functionality"
    ```

4. **Use imperative mood**: Pretend your commit completes this sentence: "If applied, this commit will **\_**"

    ```
    Good: "add user authentication"
    Bad: "added user authentication" or "adds user authentication"
    ```

5. **Review your commit**: Use `git diff` to review changes before committing

    ```bash
    git diff --cached
    git commit
    ```

6. **Use git hooks**: Set up pre-commit hooks to validate commit messages
    ```bash
    # Install commitlint to enforce message format
    npm install --save-dev @commitlint/cli @commitlint/config-conventional
    ```

### ❌ DON'T:

1. **Don't mix multiple concerns**: Keep commits focused and logical

    ```
    Bad: "fix: multiple bug fixes and improvements"
    Good: Separate commits for each fix
    ```

2. **Don't use generic messages**: Be specific and descriptive

    ```
    Bad: "fix", "wip", "stuff", "things"
    Good: "fix(makefile): resolve build target issue"
    ```

3. **Don't commit sensitive information**: Never commit passwords, API keys, or personal data

    ```bash
    # Use .gitignore for sensitive files
    echo ".env.local" >> .gitignore
    ```

4. **Don't rewrite published history**: Avoid force pushing to shared branches

    ```bash
    # Avoid on main/develop/shared branches
    git push --force  # ❌ DON'T DO THIS

    # OK for feature branches
    git push --force-with-lease origin feature-branch  # ✅ OK
    ```

5. **Don't commit incomplete work**: Ensure code is tested and working
    ```
    Bad: "wip: half-finished build script"
    Good: Complete, tested feature
    ```

## Tools & Automation

### Commitlint

Automatically validate commit messages against these conventions:

```bash
# Installation
npm install --save-dev @commitlint/cli @commitlint/config-conventional

# Create commitlint.config.js
echo "module.exports = {extends: ['@commitlint/config-conventional']}" > commitlint.config.js

# Create .husky/commit-msg hook
npx husky add .husky/commit-msg 'npx --no -- commitlint --edit "$1"'
```

### Husky + Git Hooks

Automate linting and testing before commits:

```bash
# Installation
npm install --save-dev husky
npx husky install

# Add pre-commit hook
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit 'make test'
```

### Conventional Commits Standard

This repository follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification, which enables:

- **Automatic changelog generation**
- **Semantic versioning (semver)**
- **Better commit history analysis**

### Interactive Rebase

Clean up commits before pushing:

```bash
# Rebase last 3 commits
git rebase -i HEAD~3

# In the editor:
# pick = use commit
# reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
# squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# fixup = like squash, but discard log message
```

### Amend Last Commit

Fix your most recent commit:

```bash
# Add changes to the commit
git add .
git commit --amend --no-edit

# Or edit the commit message
git commit --amend -m "feat(makefile): corrected message"
```

### Viewing Commit History

```bash
# View formatted log
git log --oneline --graph --all

# View specific author's commits
git log --author="Name" --oneline

# View commits for a specific file
git log --follow -p -- path/to/Makefile

# View commits with filtering
git log --grep="fix" --oneline
```
